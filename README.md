# notes-app

Yet another ~~todo~~ notes app, using Next.js and Supabase. There's not much too see here, this is a simple project to try SSR out with a proper database and API routes.

## Setup

Create a ´.env´ file with the following contents and copy your Supabase API keys into it.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```
